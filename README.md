You need to install Slimefun4 in order for this plugin to work.

SlimyTreeTaps is a Slimefun4 Addon that is heavily inspired by the famous mod [IndustrialCraft 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-craft).
It adds Tree Taps to Slimefun.
By using Tree Taps on any log, you are able to get Rubber, which can then be turned into Plastic.<br>
This adds an alternative way of obtaining Plastic to Slimefun.

This addon also adds a few magical aspects to the game, such as amber, magical mirrors and other amber-related items.
